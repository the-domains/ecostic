CLAMOURING THE DETAILS

Faux is a way of clamouring the details of an inspiration. And in matters of earth, details are many.   
Haaya by Ecostic are sets of patterns inspired from textures and finishes of such earthly matters. These patterns don't imitate but blend the features of other materials with the sheen of Ecostic Wallcovers to create a new advent all together.   
Choose from low contrast prints with implied features of exposed concrete, linen or wool. The accent is almost solid but it's definitely not bland. Monochromatic blends for larger spaces and soft tones.
